          Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are fellowships of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism and drug addiction. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking or using. There are no dues or fees for AA or NA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.
